    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will be learning about and implementing [Markov Chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain), if you have never heard  of them before, do not worry, this notebook will explain everything needed for the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markov chains\n",
    "The best way to introduce what a Markov chain is with a simple example. Suppose you have a simple counter that you can set to any number between 0 and 9 (including 0 and 9). At every step you roll a standard 6 -sided die and depending on whether the rolled number is even or odd you either increment or decrement the counter. If you try to increment at 9, lets say it wraps around to 0 and similarly for trying to decrement at 0. Now you can play this game for multiple steps and record the counter value after every step, this is just a simple markov chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example evolution of the markov chain,\n",
    "Start with counter at 1.\n",
    "- Step 1 : Roll a 4, its even so increment the counter to 2.\n",
    "- Step 2 : Roll a 2, its even so increment the counter to 3.\n",
    "- Step 3 : Roll a 5, its odd so decrement the counter to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A markov chain consists of a set of n states (in our example it was the 10 states of the counter) and a probabilistic rule to jump to another state every step (the dice rolls). Although in our simple example we had a similar rule for each state, you can have a different rule for each state. For example you may say that if you the counter is odd, dont roll a die, always increment, and follow the die for even states. The rule is always in the form of n probabilities that sum to one. Each probability indicates the chance that it jumps to that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example the rule for state 0 can be represented by the below numpy vector\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are in state 0, you have 50% chance of landing on state 1 (you rolled even) or a 50% chance of landing in state 9 ( you rolled odd and tried to decrement at 0)"

    "\n",
    "Write a function to return the transition matrix for the following markov chain, given the number of states as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule for the markov chain is as follows,\n",
    "\n",
    "If current state is i (and if i is not n-1)\n",
    "1. With probability 0.6, it goes to state i+1\n",
    "2. With probability 0.1, it will fall back to state i = 0.\n",
    "2. With probability 0.3, it goes to state i-1 if i is at least 1. If i is instead 0 it stays at state 0.\n",
    "3. At state n-1, instead of the above operations we stay at state n-1 with probability 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, this markov chain behaves in the following way, at every step there is an 60% chance that it climbs up by 1, a 10% chance that it falls down completely, and a 30% chance it falls down by 1. If it does reach the final state n-1, it stays there forever.\n",

    "1. First write your code in an empty cell for with a hardcoded n value, in this way you can quickly iterate and get the right answer first. Then copy it into the function.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will now use our implementation of `sample` to estimate *hitting times* in a Markov chain. The hitting time between states `i` and `j` is the average number of steps that a random walk starting from state `i` takes to hit state `j`. We will be creating a [Monte Carlo simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) to estimate this value: if we run many random walks starting from `i` and count the number of steps it takes them to reach `j`, the average number of steps we observe is (hopefully) a good approximation to the true hitting time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `hitting_time_1_walk` which takes in as arguments a transition matrix `tm`, a starting point `i`, and an ending point `j`. Your function should run a random walk starting from `i` until it hits `j`, and return the number of steps that your walk takes to hit `j`.\n"

    "Note that when applied to our markov chain from before, `hitting_time_1_walk(tm,0,n-1)` runs a random walk starting from `0` until it hits the end state `n-1`. Consequently, we expect that `hitting_time_1_walk(tm,0,n-1)` will be at most some value `k` with probability equal to `propagate(tm,0,k)[n-1]` (take some time to convince yourself of this if you are not sure of this).\n",

    "2. Write a function `proportion_at_most` which takes in as arguments an array `arr` and a value `max_value`. It should return an array with `max_value` entries, where the `i`'th entry of the output array is the proportion of the values from `arr` which are at most `i`. For example, `proportion_at_most(arr=[1,2,4,2,6], max_value = 7)` should return `[0,0.2,0.6,0.6,0.8,0.8,1,1]` (or the numpy array equivalent to this)\n",
